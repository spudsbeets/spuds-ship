# Space Cat Dodger 🚀🐱

This is a **mini game** where you fly through space attempting to dodge hordes of cats. Successfully navigate through them all, and you will reach the moon — claiming victory!  

The game features **silly drawings** and a **quirky, playful UI**, highlighting a fun and experimental approach to frontend development. It was created **prior to the AI boom** and before my formal CS education, demonstrating early examples of **crafty and unique problem-solving**.
